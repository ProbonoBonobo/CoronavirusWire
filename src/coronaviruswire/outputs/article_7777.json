Instead of being held June 4-7, the new date is Dec. 10-13.That would be the latest a major championship is played, and the first time an official LPGA Tour event was held entirely in December since Maria Hjorth won the LPGA Tour Championship in 2010.Premier League season suspended indefinitelyThe Premier League was suspended indefinitely Friday following a meeting of the 20 soccer clubs where a series of financial measures were discussed amid the coronavirus pandemic.The English league had given a tentative return date of April 30 but that was pushed back with a statement saying the \u201c2019-20 season will only return when it is safe and appropriate to do so\u201d and only with the full support of government and medical guidance.Teams still have nine or 10 games left to play, with Liverpool \u2014 the leader by 25 points \u2014 still needing two more wins to clinch its first title since 1990.UEFA, in a letter signed by the European Clubs\u2019 Association and the European Leagues, has urged members not to abandon their competitions.

Lower salaried employees, like entry-level hires, would see no reduction in pay. The cuts were first reported by Yahoo Sports.MLS does not plan to furlough or layoff staff at this time, although a hiring freeze is in place. The league employs some 300 people at its New York headquarters.The MLS move comes after the NBA cut the salaries of some 100 top executives by 20% while the season is on hold. The NHL is cutting salaries for league employees 25% starting next month. NASCAR officers will have a 25% reduction in salary, while all other employees will have their salaries reduced by 20%.Wimbledon canceled for 1st time since World War IIWimbledon was canceled on Wednesday because of the coronavirus pandemic, the first time since World War II that the oldest Grand Slam tennis tournament won&#039;t be played.The All England Club announced after an emergency meeting that the event it refers to simply as The Championships is being scrapped for 2020.Wimbledon was scheduled to be played on the club&#039;s grass courts on the outskirts of London from June 29 to July 12.Instead, the next edition of the tournament will be June 28 to July 11, 2021.The tournament was first held in 1877 and has been contested every year since, with the exception of two stretches: from 1915-18 because of World War I, and from 1940-45 because of World War II.USA Rugby filing for bankruptcy amid coronavirus shutdownUSA Rugby has decided to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy because its financial woes have been exacerbated by the coronavirus shutdown.In financial strife since 2018, USA Rugby&#039;s recent attempt to restructure was set back this month when it had to suspend all activities indefinitely in the face of the pandemic.The loss of spring and summer membership dues, and sponsorship pullback, has &amp;quot;resulted in significant loss of revenue,&amp;quot; and the sport&#039;s national board and congress agreed on Sunday that filing for Chapter 11 combined with more approved loans from World Rugby were &amp;quot;the best platform to swiftly and efficiently address challenges and deliver a foundation for future stability.&amp;quot;\u201cThe current suspension of sanctioned rugby activities caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the existing financial challenges facing the union, and a reorganization process will now be progressed with input from World Rugby,\u201d USA Rugby said in a statement Monday.The measure will protect and support the men&#039;s and women&#039;s national sevens and 15s programs, the body said.NCAA slashes distribution by $375 million Canceling March Madness because of the coronavirus pandemic will cost the NCAA about $375 million that it would have distributed to 350 schools across the nation. Some will be able to absorb the losses better than others.The NCAA announced Thursday it will distribute $225 million to its Division I member schools in June, nearly two-thirds less than the $600 million scheduled to be handed out in installments from April to June.Schools that compete in the wealthiest conferences, with billion-dollar television contracts fueled by major college football, might not notice much of a difference in the short term. Schools competing in mid-major conferences are preparing to make sacrifices.The NCAA pulled in more than $1 billion in revenue last year, including $867.5 million from the television and marketing rights for the Division I men\u2019s basketball tournament. But March Madness was canceled March 19, a week before the first round was scheduled to begin.Indianapolis 500 rescheduled to Aug. 23 The 104th Indianapolis 500, which was originally set for May 24, has been rescheduled for Aug. 23 due to concerns surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, Indianapolis Motor Speedway announced.\u201cThe Month of May at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is my favorite time of year, and like our fans, I am disappointed that we have had to reschedule the Indianapolis 500,\u201d Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Roger Penske said in a statement. \u201cHowever, the health and safety of our event participants and spectators is our top priority, and we believe that postponing the event is the responsible decision with the conditions and restrictions we are facing.&amp;quot;Prior to race day, on-track action will start with practice sessions on Aug. 12-13. That will be followed by more than a week of events, including qualifications on Aug. 15-16. A full NBC broadcast schedule will be released at a later date.Month of May Update from @IMS and @IndyCar:  The Indianapolis 500 presented by Gainbridge has been rescheduled for Sunday, Aug. 23 and the GMR Grand Prix will move to Saturday, July 4.

The New York Liberty have the No. 1 pick.NHL postpones draft and scouting combineThe NHL on Wednesday postponed three June events, including the draft, making them the latest of hockey\u2019s dominoes to fall as the coronavirus pandemic puts a hold on sporting events.The league cited \u201congoing uncertainty resulting from the coronavirus\u201d as reason for calling off the draft, which had been set for June 26 and 27 in Montreal. The timing and location of the draft and its lottery, as well as other details, will be announced once those events are finalized, the NHL statement said.The scouting combine, originally set for June 1-6 in Buffalo, New York, and the annual awards gala, scheduled for June 10 in Las Vegas, were also postponed. New dates haven\u2019t been set, but the statement added \u201cthe league looks forward to returning to Las Vegas in the future.\u201dRed Sox minor leaguer tests positive for coronavirusA minor league player for the Boston Red Sox has tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting the team to close down its training complex in Fort Myers, Florida.The Red Sox made the announcement Tuesday, a day after the positive diagnosis. The team didn&#039;t identify the player, but said he was doing well.Earlier this month, the New York Yankees said two of their minor leaguers had the virus. Those were the first two players affiliated with a big league organization known to test positive.Major League Baseball has postponed opening day until at least mid-May because of the virus outbreak.The Red Sox said their affected player was most recently at the spring training site on March 15. Boston said based on the timing of his test, it believed he most likely got the virus after leaving Fort Myers.NHL extending isolation period for players and staffThe NHL is extending its recommendation for players and staff to self-isolate and stay away from team facilities during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.Deputy commissioner Bill Daly on Tuesday confirmed the NHL has asked that players and staff extend their self-quarantine 10 days beyond the original March 27 timeline to April 6 \u2014 further pushing back the earliest team facilities can reopen.The league over the past two days has held conference calls with its Board of Governors and general managers to inform them about and take questions regarding the current situation. Daly told The Associated Press by email the calls provided updates on various issues.There is still no clarity on when the NHL might resume its season, though the CDC\u2019s recommendation of no gatherings of 50 or more people until mid-May is expected to factor into timing. The league and Players\u2019 Association told players they could go home and self-isolate until the end of March.76ers reverse course and commit to paying employeesThe NBA has been acutely affected by the coronavirus pandemic. NBA commissioner Adam Silver\u2019s March 11 decision to suspend the season was a landmark moment that started a ripple affect in sports. He stopped games when Jazz center Rudy Gobert became one of the first prominent athletes to publicly announce he contracted the virus.In the days since, NBA teams and athletes helped league employees in need, including the Bulls paying United Center employees through the remainder of the season and Zach LaVine providing 12,500 meals in Seattle.But in a time when many have chipped in, 76ers owner Josh Harris took different measures. He pledged to pay hourly employees through the remainder of the season but asked salaried workers to take a 20% paycut.After Harris\u2019 decision was roundly criticized on social media and from within the 76ers organization, he reversed course and committed to paying his staff. Public responses from 76ers center Joel Embiid and co-owner Michael Rubin likely played a part in the decision.76ers ownership is planning to change course, pulling back on salary reductions for staff, league source tells ESPN.&amp;mdash; Adrian Wojnarowski (@wojespn) March 24, 2020  \u201cAfter listening to our staff and players, it\u2019s clear that was the wrong decision. We have reversed it and will be paying these employees their full salary,\u201d Harris told ESPN\u2019s Adrian Wojnarowski in a statement.Champions League final postponedUEFA formally postponed the Champions League final on Monday \u2014 an inevitable move with European soccer in total shutdown and four Round of 16 games yet to be completed.The final was scheduled for May 30 in Istanbul before the spreading coronavirus pandemic forced the four remaining second-leg games on March 17-18 to be delayed indefinitely.UEFA said no decision has yet been made on finding a new date.The shutdown has no end in sight, though UEFA and European soccer leaders said last week they hope to complete the club season by June 30.The 2020 European Championship for national teams was postponed for one year to clear space in the fixture calendar for clubs to win titles in domestic leagues and cups, and UEFA&#039;s competitions.UEFA said the Europa League final, due on May 27 in Gdansk, Poland, and the Women\u2019s Champions League final, scheduled for May 24 in Vienna, Austria, were also postponed.Men\u2019s hockey worlds canceledHealth concerns and travel bans closing international borders stemming from the new coronavirus pandemic left the International Ice Hockey Federation with no choice but to cancel the men\u2019s world hockey championships.The decision to cancel the 16-team tournament to be held in Switzerland in May was formally announced Saturday, and essentially wipes out the IIHF\u2019s entire spring calendar of world championship of events.The governing body previously canceled the women\u2019s world hockey championships set to be held in Canada and the men\u2019s Under-18 championship to be played in Michigan next month.NBA shutters facilities indefinitelyThe number of known coronavirus cases within the NBA doubled to 14 on Thursday, when Marcus Smart of the Boston Celtics pleaded with people to take social distancing more seriously and the league ordered all teams to shutter their training facilities indefinitely.Smart revealed that he tested positive and the Los Angeles Lakers said two of their players tested positive as well, bringing the number of players who have acquired the virus to 10. The Philadelphia 76ers said three members of their organization tested positive and the Denver Nuggets said someone within their franchise was positive as well.The 76ers and Nuggets did not say if the affected people were players, coaches or other staff.The league wants its teams to keep distance as well.

The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Tuesday because the decision has not been announced.It follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#039;s recommendation that events of 50 people or more not be held for eight weeks. That would last until the Sunday before the PGA Championship.San Francisco now is among six counties in the Bay Area where residents are ordered to venture outside only when necessary for the next three weeks.There was no indication when the PGA Championship would be played, or if it would remain in San Francisco.Shortly after the PGA Championship announcement, the PGA Tour said it was canceling an additional four tournaments on its schedule \u2014 the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, the Zurich Classic of New Orleans, the Wells Fargo Championship in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the AT&amp;amp;T Byron Nelson in Dallas.French Open postponed until September The French Open tennis tournament was postponed for about four months because of the coronavirus pandemic, shifting from May to September.Main-draw matches for the clay-court tournament at Roland Garros in Paris were scheduled to begin on May 24.This is the first instance of a Grand Slam tournament being affected by the virus that has spread around the world.

The ban was lifted on May 8, and the Derby was held on June 9. The only other year the Derby wasn\u2019t held in May was in 1901, when it was raced on April 29.The Derby is the latest major sporting event to be postponed or canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak, joining the men\u2019s and women\u2019s NCAA basketball tournaments and the Masters golf tournament.

It affects seven total races \u2014 Atlanta and Homestead had already been postponed.The series plans to return to the track at Martinsville Speedway in Virginia on May 9.\u201cWe intend to hold all 36 races this season, with future rescheduling soon to be determined as we continue to monitor this situation closely with public health officials and medical experts,\u201d NASCAR said. &amp;quot;What is important now transcends the world of sports and our focus is on everyone\u2019s safety and well-being as we navigate this challenging time together.\u201dNASCAR first said it would run last weekend and this coming weekend without spectators, but reversed course Friday and postponed the races at Atlanta Motor Speedway and Homestead-Miami Speedway.NASCAR had not addressed anything beyond Homestead until Monday\u2019s announcement.Sports in Britain grind to a haltSports in Britain virtually ground to a halt on Monday as the government ramped up its efforts to tackle the coronavirus by advising against mass gatherings in the country.The iconic Grand National Steeplechase, the Oxford vs. Cambridge university boat race, all levels of rugby union and rugby league, and the lower levels in soccer were among the remaining events or competitions to be canceled or suspended amid the pandemic.Elite soccer, such as the widely watched English Premier League, had already been suspended last week after individuals at clubs tested positive for the virus.But Monday marked a significant shift in the government\u2019s position, with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson advising the public to take extra steps in the face of the virus. Britain has had 1,543 confirmed cases and 53 virus-related deaths.NHL further delays possible season restartThe NHL is pushing back the possibility of resuming its season by several weeks, if not a month or more.The league and NHL Players&#039; Association told players Monday they can go home \u2014 even out of North America \u2014 and must self-isolate through March 27 while the season is on hold amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the NHL also cautioned that it will not be able to even provide guidance on the potential reopening of team practices for another 45 days, which could push any potential return to play into May.The new directives come on the heels of the CDC&#039;s recommendation against gatherings of 50 or more people in the U.S. for the next eight weeks. The NHL said \u201cdepending on world developments,&amp;quot; consideration will be given to reopening facilities after the self-quarantine period ends in late March but practices for the 31 teams would not happen late April \u2014 at the earliest.MLB pushes opening day back againMajor League Baseball pushed back opening day until mid-May at the earliest on Monday because of the new coronavirus after the federal government recommended restricting events of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks.Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred made the announcement following a conference call with executives of the 30 teams.\u201cThe clubs remain committed to playing as many games as possible when the season begins,\u201d the commissioner&#039;s office said in a statement.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Sunday that gatherings of 50 people or more be canceled or postponed across the country for the next eight weeks.MLB called off the rest of the spring training schedule on Thursday and said opening day, which had been scheduled for March 26, was postponed for at least two weeks. Teams and players agree that two to four weeks of additional spring training will be needed before the regular season begins.The Major League Baseball Players Association sent an email to agents on Monday saying that for players who went home or to their team&#039;s regular-season city it would pay $1,100 allowances through April 9 to players on 40-man rosters as of March 13. That amount also would go to players with minor league contracts at big league spring training who were on 40-man rosters at the end of last season.The union also is negotiating with MLB over resetting the dates for players with opt-out clauses in their deals. The sides also are likely to agree on a roster freeze.This year marked the earliest opening day other than for international games. As it stood, Game 7 of the World Series would have been Oct. 28, and teams and players could push the postseason into November.Any change to the 162-game schedule would necessitate bargaining over an array of issues, including when and how much players get paid and how much major league service they are credited for. Service time determines eligibility for free agency and salary arbitration.NFL draft events canceledThe NFL will proceed with its draft but without public events next month in Las Vegas. It&#039;s not yet clear, however, if the draft itself will be held in the city.Commissioner Roger Goodell said Monday the draft will take place April 23-25 as scheduled, but under a modified format still being developed.

Grothman asked, \u201cIs the NBA underreacting or is the Ivy League overreacting?\u201d He was referencing how the Ivy League recently canceled its basketball tournaments, instead of having them played without fans in attendance or keeping the status quo.\u201cWe would recommend that there not be large crowds,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cIf that means not having any people in the audience when the NBA plays, so be it. But as a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.\u201dCBI canceledThe College Basketball Invitational \u2014 the third NCAA basketball tournament \u2014 has been canceled \u201cdue to the uncertainty about the coronavirus and the impact it is having on college campuses across the country.\u201dStatement regarding the 2020 CBI pic.twitter.com/5SPabjpC1V&amp;mdash; College BBall Invit.

Texas general manager Jon Daniels said Monday there hadn\u2019t been any discussion with MLB or the Mariners about swapping home dates for that opening series between AL West rivals, but said the new ballpark would be ready if it is needed.Exhibition games against St. Louis are scheduled at the new stadium on March 23 and 24.Rangers catcher Robinson Chirinos said Tuesday he is \u201ca little bit\u201d concerned about traveling to face the Mariners.&amp;quot;I know the season starts in Seattle, and we know how Seattle is right now,&amp;quot; Chirinos said.Mid-American, Big West conferences limit fansOn Tuesday, the Mid-American Conference said it was implementing a restricted attendance policy at its men\u2019s and women\u2019s basketball tournaments in Cleveland this week.
